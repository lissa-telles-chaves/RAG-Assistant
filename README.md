# RAG Assistant
## 🌐Domain overview and problem statement.
#### ♻️**Domain**: ESG
ESG has shifted from "voluntary marketing" to "mandatory financial risk."
#### ♻️**Problem Statement**: 
Manual data retrieval is not only a massive drain on high-value human capital but also introduces error. In an era of anti-greenwashing litigation, a single data oversight can lead to multi-million dollar fines and reputational ruin. This RAG Assistant condences all this information, enabling users to instantly retrieve cited insights from reliable corpuses, transforming a 10-hour manual audit into a 10-second query.
